## readme.md: Auto-Organizer - Your Friendly File Janitor ()

**Feeling overwhelmed by a messy desktop?**  Don't worry, Auto-Organizer is here to save the day!  This cool Python script will automatically sort your files into neat folders, keeping your digital world organized and tidy.  ✨

**What It Does:**

* **Scans your files:** Auto-Organizer is like a detective ️‍♂️, searching through your chosen folder for different file types based on their extensions (.jpg, .pdf, etc.).
* **Creates Folders:** Based on the file types it finds, Auto-Organizer creates new folders so you can easily find what you need.  
* **Moves Your Files:** Like a helpful friend, Auto-Organizer carefully moves your files into their new folders, making your desktop squeaky clean! 

**Supported File Types:**

* Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, .svg)  ️
* Videos (.mp4, .mkv, .mov)  
* Presentations (.pptx)  
* Documents (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .srt, .txt)  
* Applications (.apk)  
* Data Sheets (.csv)  
* MS Docs (.xlsx)  
* Executables (.exe)  
* Zips (.zip)  
* Music (.mp3, .wav)  

**Let's Get Started! (It's Easy!)**

1. **Download:** Save this script as `auto_organizer.py` (or any name you like).
2. **Edit (Optional):** If you want to organize a specific folder other than your desktop,  you can change the `directory` variable in the script to point to that folder. But the default is your user directory (`~`).
3. **Run the Script:** Open your terminal (a black window where you can type commands) and type `python auto_organizer.py`. Hit Enter, and Auto-Organizer will start working its magic! ✨  **(Double-clicking might not work on Windows - check online for help!)**


**Important Tips:**

* **Back Up Your Files (Just in Case!)** ⛑️ It's always a good idea to back up your data before running any script. 
* **Permissions Matter!**   Make sure you have permission to read and write in the folder you want to organize.

**Want to Help Make Auto-Organizer Even Better?**
